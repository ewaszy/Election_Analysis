## Overview of Election Audit

The purpose of the election audit analysis was to create a code that can be used to declare a winning candidate and the county with the highest voter turnout by determining the voting statistics for each candidate and county. The code inputs data from a csv file and outputs a text of the results into the terminal as well as into a text file.  

The first image illustrates the terminal output.

## Election-Audit Summary

This script can be used for any election with some modifications. For example, we could use it to analyze the presidential election. We would have to modify the code to determine the winner between only two candidates, perform an analysis of votes at the state level, and determine the highest voter turnout at the state level. This code can also be modified to perform an analysis for mayoral elections within a single city. For this type of election, the candidates and the candidate statistics would be determined in the same way. The code can be modified to perform an analysis of votes for each district in the city, and use it to determine the district with the highest voter turnout.
